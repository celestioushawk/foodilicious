We have created a website where users can share their recipes and view the recipes of the other users as well. It has the functionalities to surf through the recipes without the need to login. To view the full recipe, user needs to login mandatorily. It has a login and a sign-up page from where the user can either login or sign up to make an account and then login. The user is then directed to the home page of the website where s/he can explore the recipes. On clicking a particular recipe, a new page is opened displaying the complete recipe with all additional information about it. 
Another feature we have included in the website is to add userâ€™s own recipe. When a user is logged in, s/he can upload their own recipe and can also edit it later on if needed. The user also has an option to bookmark or save any recipe they want to for future reference. For user comfort purpose, we have also given the functionality of Forgot Password to user where he/she can reset her password and login again hassle free.
